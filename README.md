# Crazy Eigths Rules implemented

SPECIAL CARDS: <br />
JACK(11) --> WILDCARD: CAN BE PLAYED ON ANY CIRCUMSTANCE EVEN IF THE CARD IS NOT OF THE SAME TYPE OR VALUE AS THE CARD ON THE DECK. <br />
ACE(1) --> REVERSE THE BOARD. <br />
TWO(2) --> MAKE THE NEXT PLAYER DRAW 2 EXTRA CARDS AND SKIP THE NEXT PLAYER TURN. <br />
QUEEN(12) --> SKIP THE NEXT PLAYER TURN. <br />

-This is a classic card game, meaning that the deck is a full 52 card. <br />
-Each player starts with a minimum of 5 cards in hand up to a maximum of 8 random cards. <br />
-The first player to play puts a card of any type on the discard deck. <br />
-If a card is on the discard deck, a player needs to play a card of the same type or same value as the value or type on the draw deck. He can also play a wildcard(11 JACK) meaning that it can change the type even if the JACK is not of the type of the card at the top of the deck.
 Otherwise, he will need to draw a card and skip his turn. <br />
-If a player plays a Queen(12), the next player will skip his turn. <br />
-If a player plays a 2, the next player will draw two aditionnals cards AND skip his turn. <br />
-If a player plays an Ace(1), the board will be reverse, meaning that it will either go clockwise or counter clockwise. <br />
